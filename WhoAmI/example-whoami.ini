rem  Example whoami.ini configuration file.
rem  You can comment a line out just by putting REM on the front of it.
rem  / is most definately not a comment, it's inherited from the
rem  command line parameter format, and must preceed all parameters.

rem  Set the colour depth. Options are /4 /8 /16 /24 /32 bits per pixel.
/16


rem  Don't like the information in the top right? Well put is somewhere
rem  else! Set the /x position with left,right, middle or a pixel position
rem  Then do the same to /y with top,bottom,middle or pixel position.
rem  Whoami defaults to /x=right /y=top
rem /x=middle
rem /x=right
rem /x=left
rem /x=400
rem /y=top
rem /y=middle
rem /y=bottom
rem /y=400

rem  Want to change how the text lines up to suit your new custom location?
rem  Then use /j. Options are left,right and middle.
rem  If you don't specify a justify option, Whoami will use left justification
rem  for /x=left and /x=pixel. Right justification for /x=right and middle
rem  for /x=middle

rem /j=middle
rem /j=left
rem /j=right


rem  Set the font.
/fontname=arial


rem  Set the prefix text to place before the machine name
rem /machineprfx=PC name


rem  Set the default font size.
/fontsize=12


rem  Set the specific font size for the machine name.
/machinesize=20


rem  Set the specific font size for the user name.
/usersize=16


rem  I'm not setting the ipsize, so it will be 12 as that was set in the
rem  /fontsize default.
rem /ipsize=12


rem  Enable the log on time display.
/time


rem  Set the time format. The dafault uses the windows short time and short
rem  date, but I want my own.
/timeformat=hh:mm ddd dd/mm/yyyy


rem  Set the time size... Nice and small.
/timesize=10


rem  Set the text to transparent. By default it's printed on the current
rem  windows background colour so this won't actually make a difference, but if
rem  you use a baseimage you might want to use it.
rem  If the base image makes the text hard to see, either change the text
rem  colour, or remove the /transtext setting. That way the text will have a
rem  solid background colour.
/transtext


rem  Want to put the information over an image... No problem.
rem  Specify the name of the bitmap or jpeg as shown below.
rem  If the bitmap is smaller than the screen, it will be placed in the centre
rem  of the screen. If you want to tile it, just include the /tile parameter.
rem  If you want to stretch the baseimage to the full screen size, just include
rem  the /stretch parameter.
rem /baseimage=c:\tile.bmp
rem /stretch
rem /tile


rem  Set the text colour. Default is white.
rem /textcolor=192,192,192
rem /textcolour=80ffff


rem  Set the wallpaper background colour. Default is current windows background colour.
rem /bgcolor=128,128,255
rem /bgcolour=8080ff


rem  Below are some examples of reading data from the registry.
rem  The registry features are unusual in that you may include several in the
rem  parameters. They will be added to the bottom of the wallpaper data area
rem  in the order they are listed in the parameters.
rem  Please note that only HKLM and HKCU fields can be read by whoami.
rem  Further resrictions may be imposed by you windows security rating.
rem 
rem  The example below will display the current windows productID, and then
rem  the name of the highest score in Minesweeper, along with the time they
rem  took in both decimal and hex.
rem  Sorry about the rather amusing example, but finding a useful cross-system
rem  example of an integer (Dword) field is a nightmare! :)
rem /regsize=10
rem /regstr=HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ProductId
rem /regstr=HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\winmine\Name1
rem /regint=HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\winmine\Time1
rem /reghex=HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\winmine\Time1

rem  Please note, regstr regint and reghex are now only support for backward capatiblity, and
rem  may be removed in future releases.
rem  Please use the more powerful /reg= function.
rem  Keys may now be nested. For example, to get the current hardware profile you have to
rem  get the integer from HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\IDConfigDB\CurrentConfig
rem  pad that to 4 digits, then use it to access
rem  HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\IDConfigDB\Hardware Profiles\xxxx\Friendlyn
rem  where xxxx is the padded integer.
rem  To use embedded keys place brackets round the key. After the open bracket you must put
rem  the number of characters you need to make the next key followed by a comma.

/reg=HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\IDConfigDB\Hardware Profiles\(4,HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\IDConfigDB\CurrentConfig)\Friendlyname

rem  Other useful registry keys
rem  The following will display the operating system version

/reg=HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProductName

rem  and service pack level.

/reg=HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\CSDVersion


rem  Want some extra fixed information displayed on the wallpaper?
rem  Then use the /extrafile and /extrasize options.
rem  the file should be in standard raw text format as generated by notepad.
rem  If the filename is invalid, whoami will ignore it. No error is shown.
/extrasize=8
/extrafile=c:\extrainfo.txt


rem  By deault whoami will store the wallpaper in the "my documents" folder of the current user.
rem  This is the option you should use if you are using the switch users feature of XP.
rem  If you want to specify a single location for the wallpaper image, then the following
rem  parameter does just that.
rem /paperdir=c:\
rem  There are two special values.
rem  1) If omitted or set to nothing, then the current users "my documents" folder is used.
rem  2) if set to windows, then the windows directory is used. In NT4 and 2000 this is usually c:\winnt
rem     Just set /paperdir=windows and whoami will use whatever directory is set for the current OS.
