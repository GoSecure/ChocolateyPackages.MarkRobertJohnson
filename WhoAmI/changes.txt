New param /autobg
If whoami spots a non-whoami wallpaper when it is run, it will copy the current wallpaper into the paperdir (or current user's "my documents" if paperdir omitted) and call it "kewlit-bgimage.bmp" then use this as the base image to generate the new wallpaper.
If whoami was called with an ini file, it will then modify the whoami.ini to include the new baseimage location.
