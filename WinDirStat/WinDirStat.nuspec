        <description>On start up, it reads the whole directory tree once and then presents it in three useful views:
•The directory list, which resembles the tree view of the Windows Explorer but is sorted by file/subtree size,
•The treemap, which shows the whole contents of the directory tree straight away,
•The extension list, which serves as a legend and shows statistics about the file types.</description>
